### How can I report a security bug?

You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team helps validate, triage, and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability here](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/query-monitor).

Do not report security issues on GitHub or the WordPress.org support forums. Thank you.
