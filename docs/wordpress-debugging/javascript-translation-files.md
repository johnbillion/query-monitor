# Debugging translation files in Query Monitor

<!-- @todo docs about PHP/MO/PO translations -->

[WordPress 5.0 introduced the ability to use internationalisation functions in JavaScript and provide Jed translations for messages that use them](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/09/new-javascript-i18n-support-in-wordpress/).

Query Monitor fully supports debugging the loading of these translation files in the Languages panel, so you know which files WordPress is attempting to load:
