# Debugging blocks in Query Monitor

The Blocks panel in Query Monitor lists all of the blocks on the current page, along with their attributes and other debugging information. Nested blocks (for example for groups or columns) are fully supported.

If you're developing dynamic blocks, the block render callback and render timing information will help you keep an eye on performance that can otherwise be difficult to measure.
