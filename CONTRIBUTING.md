## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in Query Monitor, please report it to [the security program on HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/johnblackbourn). Do not report security issues on GitHub or the WordPress.org support forums. Thank you.

## Setting up Locally

You can clone this repo and activate it like a normal WordPress plugin, but you'll need to install the developer dependencies in order to build the assets and you'll need to have Docker Desktop installed to run the tests.

### Prerequisites

* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/)

### Setup

1. Install the PHP dependencies:

       composer install

2. Install the Node dependencies:

       npm install

## Building the Assets

To compile the Sass files into CSS:

	npm run build

To start the file watcher which will watch for changes and automatically compile the Sass:

	npm run watch

## Running the Tests

The test suite includes acceptance tests which run in a Docker container. Ensure Docker Desktop is running, then start the containers with:

	composer test:start

To run the whole test suite which includes integration tests, acceptance tests, linting, and static analysis:

	composer test

To run just the integration tests:

	composer test:integration

To run just the acceptance tests:

	composer test:acceptance

To run just the code sniffer:

	composer test:phpcs

To run just the static analysis:

	composer test:phpstan

To stop the Docker containers:

	composer test:stop

## Releasing a New Version

These are the steps to take to release a new version of Query Monitor (for contributors who have push access to the GitHub repo).

### Prior to Release

1. Check [the milestone on GitHub](https://github.com/johnbillion/query-monitor/milestones) for open issues or PRs. Fix or reassign as necessary.
1. If this is a non-patch release, check issues and PRs assigned to the patch or minor milestones that will get skipped. Reassign as necessary.
1. Ensure you're on the `develop` branch and all the changes for this release have been merged in.
1. Ensure both `README.md` and `readme.txt` contain up to date descriptions, "Tested up to" versions, FAQs, screenshots, etc.
1. Ensure `.gitattributes` is up to date with all files that shouldn't be part of the build.
   - To do this, run `git archive --output=qm.zip HEAD` then check the contents for files that shouldn't be part of the package.
1. Run `composer test` and ensure everything passes.
1. Prepare a changelog for [the Releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/johnbillion/query-monitor/releases).

### For Release

1. Bump the plugin version number:
   - `npm run bump:patch` for a patch release (1.2.3 => 1.2.4)
   - `npm run bump:minor` for a minor release (1.2.3 => 1.3.0)
   - `npm run bump:major` for a major release (1.2.3 => 2.0.0)
1. `git push origin develop`
1. Wait until (and ensure that) [the build passes](https://github.com/johnbillion/query-monitor/actions)
1. `git push origin develop:release`
1. Wait for [the Build action](https://github.com/johnbillion/query-monitor/actions/workflows/build.yml) to complete
1. Enter the changelog into [the release on GitHub](https://github.com/johnbillion/query-monitor/releases) and publish it.

### Post Release

Publishing a release on GitHub triggers an action which deploys the release to the WordPress.org Plugin Directory. No need to touch Subversion.

New milestones are automatically created for the next major, minor, and patch releases where appropriate.

1. Close the milestone.
1. If this is a non-patch release, manually delete any [unused patch and minor milestones on GitHub](https://github.com/johnbillion/query-monitor/milestones).
1. Check the new version has appeared [on the WordPress.org plugin page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/) (it'll take a few minutes).
1. Resolve relevant threads on [the plugin's support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/query-monitor/).
1. Consume tea and cake as necessary.

### Asset Updates

Assets such as screenshots and banners are stored in the `.wordpress-org` directory. These get deployed as part of the automated release process too.

In order to deploy only changes to assets, push the change to the `deploy` branch and they will be deployed if they're the only changes in the branch since the last release. This allows for the "Tested up to" value to be bumped as well as assets to be updated in between releases.
